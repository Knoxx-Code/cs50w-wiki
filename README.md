# cs50w-wiki
This is Project 1 in the CS50W: Web Development with Python and JavaScript, which I did to practice Django. 
It involved creating a Wiki clone that has the functionality of:
 - Creating and adding entries to the Wiki
 - Updating existing entries by editing the content
 - Searching for entries within the Wiki
 - Navigation to a Random page once the 'Random Page' link is clicked
